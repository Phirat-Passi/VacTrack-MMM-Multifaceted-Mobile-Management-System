\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An object of type \code{connectionDetails} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{createConnectionDetails}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connection} is
provided.}

\item{connection}{An object of type \code{connection} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{connect}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connectionDetails}
is provided, in which case a new connection will be opened at the start
of the function, and closed when the function finishes.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your patient-level data in OMOP CDM format resides.
Note that for SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{tempEmulationSchema}{Should be used in emulate a temporary schema.}

\item{cohortDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your cohort table resides. Note that for SQL Server,
this should include both the database and schema name, for example
'scratch.dbo'.}

\item{cohortTable}{Name of the cohort table.}

\item{createCohortTable}{Create the cohort table? If \code{incremental = TRUE} and the
table already exists this will be skipped.}

\item{incremental}{Create only cohorts that haven't been created before?}
\item{incrementalFolder}{If \code{incremental = TRUE}, specify a folder where records are
kept of which definition has been executed.}
\item{packageName}{The name of the package containing the cohort definitions. Can be left
NULL if \code{baseUrl} and \code{cohortSetReference} have been
specified.}
\item{cohortToCreateFile}{The location of the cohortToCreate file within the package. Is ignored
if \code{baseUrl} and \code{cohortSetReference} have been specified.}
\item{baseUrl}{The base URL for the WebApi instance, for example:
"http://server.org:80/WebAPI". Can be left NULL if \code{packageName}
and \code{cohortToCreateFile} have been specified.}
\item{cohortSetReference}{A data frame with four columns, as described in the details. Can be left
NULL if \code{packageName} and \code{cohortToCreateFile} have been
specified.}
\item{cohortIds}{Optionally, provide a subset of cohort IDs to restrict the
construction to.}
\item{generateInclusionStats}{Compute and store inclusion rule statistics?}
\item{inclusionStatisticsFolder}{The folder where the inclusion rule statistics are stored. Can be
left NULL if \code{generateInclusionStats = FALSE}.}
}
\description{
This function instantiates a set of cohort in the cohort table, using definitions that are fetched
from a WebApi interface. Optionally, the inclusion rule statistics are computed and stored in the
\code{inclusionStatisticsFolder}.
}
\details{
Currently two ways of executing this function are supported, either (1) embedded in a study
package, assuming the cohort definitions are stored in that package using the
\code{ROhdsiWebApi::insertCohortDefinitionSetInPackage}, or (2) by using a WebApi interface to
retrieve the cohort definitions. When using this function from within a study package, use the
\code{packageName} and \code{cohortToCreateFile} to specify the name of the study package, and the
name of the cohortToCreate file within that package, respectively When using this function using a
WebApi interface, use the \code{baseUrl} and \code{cohortSetReference} to specify how to connect to
the WebApi, and which cohorts to fetch, respectively.
The \code{cohortSetReference} argument must be a data frame with the following columns: \describe{
\item{atlasId}{The cohort ID in ATLAS.} \item{atlasName}{The full name of the cohort. This will be
shown in the Shiny app.} \item{cohortId}{The cohort ID to use in the package. Usually the same as
the cohort ID in ATLAS.} \item{name}{A short name for the cohort, to use to create file names. do
not use special characters.} }
}
