    1)The MMM is a proposed web application accessible by computers/mobile devices to collect different types of data relating to each VacPack. 
    2)The MMM collects data from VacPack using its bluetooth system and aggregates extra data with input from VacPack distribution teams:
       
       a)Vaccine recipient information:
             Demographics: name, gender, race, ethnicity
             Contacts: address, DOB, phone, email
             Info: administration site, immunization history
       
       b)VacPack information:
             Temperature
             GPRS location
             Vaccine type, expiry dates, remaining #
             
       c)VacPack efficacy ratings:
             Average VacPack energy consumption rate
             Average VacPack vaccine spoilage rate
             Average # of safety compliance issues
      
# IZ (Immunization) Gateway

The Immunization Gateway (IZ Gateway) is a cloud-based message routing service intended to enable data exchange among jurisdiction IIS, other provider systems, and the CDC Immunization Data Clearinghouse (IZ Data Clearinghouse). The IZ Gateway enables IISs, federal agencies, and private partners to connect and share immunization information. It also enables providers to update, query, and report immunization data to an IIS. By using centralized data exchange, it avoids the need for multiple, individual, point-to-point connections. 
The IZ Gateway designed, developed, aims to increase the availability and volume of complete and accurate immunization data stored within IIS and available to providers and consumers regardless of their jurisdictional boundaries. The IZ Gateway will support

  •Cross-state query and data sharing
  •Administrative data reporting
  •Inventory reporting 
  •Mass vaccination reporting, and 
  •Consumer access tools

The Immunization Gateway (IZ Gateway) is a portfolio of components that share a common IT infrastructure. These components support the exchange of immunization data between immunization information systems (IISs), provider organizations, and consumer applications. The IZ Gateway can streamline time- and resource-intensive data exchange onboarding. It also replaces multiple one-to-one connections with centralized routing.

# VAMS (Vaccine Administration Management System)

Mobile App to register, document, and report vaccinations for temporary, high-volume sites. Option for state and provider use.

VAMS is an easy-to-use, secure, online tool to manage vaccine administration from the time the vaccine arrives at a clinic until it is administered to a recipient. VAMS is free for public health-approved clinics, and can be used on computers, tablets, and other mobile devices. It is not a smartphone app, and no installation or download is required for this web-based platform. VAMS has robust security that is shared with Amazon Web Services, which is certified by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).

Timely gathering of vaccination data for analysis is critical in ongoing vaccination efforts. VAMS allows for gathering and analysis of real-time or near-real-time vaccination data in vaccination clinics.

# VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Systems)

VAERS will be directly co-administered by CDC and FDA (Food and Drug Administration) of Haiti, is the national frontline monitoring system for vaccine safety, a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines based on the review formulated by assessing the data collected.
